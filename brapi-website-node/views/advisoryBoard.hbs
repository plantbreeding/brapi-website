                <h2> Roles and Responsibilities </h2>
                <p>The BrAPI Advisory Board is a group of six members nominated from the BrAPI community. This group is
                    responsible for the long-term direction and priorities of the project. While the BrAPI Project
                    Coordinator is handling the day-to-day needs of the project, the Advisory Board meets quarterly to
                    address larger questions and concerns. They represent the diversity of the wider community and they
                    advise the Project Coordinator on the needs of the community. The board was formed to provide a
                    balance to the authority of the Project Coordinator and to give the community a voice in the
                    decision making process. The time commitment for each member of the Advisory Board is low, only
                    about 4-8 hours per year. </p>

                <h2> Turnover Process</h2>
                <p>Advisory Board members will serve in 3-year terms. These terms will be staggered so that only two
                    members will be replaced each year. This should provide some stability within the board as a
                    majority of the members would be maintained from year to year. Each year, there will be a general
                    call for nominations from the community to find new members. If there are only two nominees, then
                    they will be accepted immediately. If there are more nominees than positions available, a general
                    community election will be held to choose the best candidates. The existing board members will have
                    the right to veto any nominee selection if there are concerns about a conflict of interest or if the
                    nominee seems unwilling to act in the best interest of the community. </p>

                <h2> Nominations </h2>
                <p>Each year, there will be a general call for nominations. Anyone in the BrAPI community may nominate
                    themselves or someone else to become a representative on the Advisory Board. Previous board members
                    may also be nominated, but they cannot server two consecutive terms. The BrAPI Project Coordinator
                    and any PI's involved with the funding of the project may not be nominated. </p>
                <p>Each nominee will be required to complete a short, guided, report to outline the skills and
                    experience they possess that makes them a good candidate. This report will be used ensure a good mix
                    of the diverse BrAPI community is represented on the board. If a vote becomes necessary, the reports
                    will also be used to convey information about each candidate to the voters. </p>
                <p>The Advisory Board Skills Report will ask nominees about their skill level and relevant experience
                    with the following topics:</p>
