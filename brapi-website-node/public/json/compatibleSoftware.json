It unambiguously identifies all objects and traits in an experiment and establishes their relations via ontologies and semantics that apply to both field and controlled conditions. Its ontology-driven architecture is a powerful tool for integrating and managing data from multiple experiments and platforms, for creating relationships between objects and enriching datasets with knowledge and metadata. It is MIAPPE and BrAPI compliant, and naming conventions are recommended for users to declare their resources. Several experimental platforms use PHIS to manage their data, and PHIS instances dedicated to sharing resources (projects, genetic resources, variables) also exist to allow the sharing of studied concepts.",
